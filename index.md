# Barnes Portfolio
This is my class project page. 

## About Me...
I am Rebekah Barnes and my pronouns are she, her, hers. I am an Army War College (AWC) Student assigned to CMU Heinz College. My goal is to take classes that will assist me in developing compelling papers for senior Leaders in the Army to use for decision making. 

### What I hope to learn...
I hope to learn how to synthesize data for decision makers to process quickly and provide guidance for workers. My primary assignment from the AWC is two write two papers. I have a very broad topic on identifying the Army role in responding to cyber-attacks. I hope to learn more about Artificial Intelligence and smart technologies to understand how we can modernize networks using them.
